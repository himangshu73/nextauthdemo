## My Journey Building a Next.js Markdown Blog

Over the last few days, I've created a markdown blog using Next.js. Coming from a WordPress background, this was an exciting new experience that taught me several valuable concepts.

## Key Learnings

### File System Operations
- Learned to use Node.js File System (fs) to:
  - Read from folders and files
  - Create custom paths
  - Generate slugs from file paths

### Markdown Processing
- Implemented gray-matter to extract frontmatter metadata
- Converted markdown to HTML using remark plugins
- Added tailwind typography plugin to global.css

### Next.js Features
- Utilized Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance
- Created different layouts for homepage and individual posts
- Implemented semantic HTML with `<header>` and `<section>` elements
