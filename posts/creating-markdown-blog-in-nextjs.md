Over the last few days, I have created a markdown blog in Nextjs. This is a new experience for me. Previosly, I have created blogs with wordpress. In the process, I have learnt the following:

* Node File System (Fs)
* How to create slug from path 
* How to create custom path
* How to read from folder and file
* How to extract meta data using gray-matter
* How to render markdown in HTML
* How to use Static Site Generation (SSG)
* How to write post in markdown
* Use _header_ and _section_ in the single blog page

I have created different layout for my blog. My main home page layout is different. This is good learning curve for me.
